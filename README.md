# Food-Processor-Render-Pipeline
A Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline that delivers delicious visuals for PC systems. It's designed to be flexible, so you can add your own ingredients. It will feed even the largest of appetites, but at the same time tries to not choke integrated graphics systems too badly. Warning: Currently in early alpha. RESULTS ARE NOT EVEN REMOTELY SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION!
