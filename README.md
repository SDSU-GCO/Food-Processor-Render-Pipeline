# Food-Processor-Render-Pipeline
A Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline that delivers delicious visuals for PC systems. It's designed to be flexible, so you can add your own ingredients. It will feed even the largest of appetites, but at the same time tries to not choke integrated graphics systems too badly. 

**Warning: Currently in early alpha. RESULTS ARE NOT EVEN REMOTELY SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION!**

Contributers, please read the FP Developer Reference and look at the KanBan board.

### About GCO
Game Creation Organization is a student organization at South Dakota State University which tries to make awesome video games. The organization was founded in 2013 and experimented with homebrew console games until 2015 when the group migrated to Unity. New members and mentors develop small games each semester while the remaining members work on a large infinite-scope multi-year project called The Game Sword Legacy.

### License Rant:
We either have a restrictive license or no license. We want to make our license as permissive as possible, but we have some things in the repo which make that difficult. We have test artwork, some of it is our art that we want everyone to use, some of it is art from free assets on the Asset Store (which may or may not have remained free from the time we added them to our project), and some of it is artwork copied from the internet from lazy programmers who don't care about copyright.
